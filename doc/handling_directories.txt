Example for managing directories:

md path: mkdir
cd path: changedir (set current working dir)
rn oldname=newname: rename file or directory

example:
open #1,"100"
print #1,"md /test"
print #1,"cd /test"
print #1,"md a"
print #1,"rn a=b"
close #1

You may use multiple commands in one print statement, eg.

print #1,"md /test,cd /test,md a,rn a=b"
